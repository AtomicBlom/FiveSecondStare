FiveSecondStare
---------------

This is a stupid proof of concept mod.

It removes the ability to right click on RFTools machines and requires that you stare at a certain pixel on the front 
for five seconds in order to open the UI.

If you want to use this mod (?) You will need to download and compile it yourself. I will not be releasing binaries for 
it.

It was created as a joke I was having with McJty, together with Boni and Vaygrim.
